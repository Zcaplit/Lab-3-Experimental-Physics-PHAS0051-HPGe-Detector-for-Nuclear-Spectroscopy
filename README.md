# Lab-3-Experimental-Physics-PHAS0051-HPGe-Detector-for-Nuclear-Spectroscopy
This lab involvs tons of data analysis, and thus Python script is used extensively. 
This main purpose is for records.

Here will be two main files: Spectra.py and Exe.ipynb,
the first of which encodes the main tool, a massive python class,
and the second is an example Python notebook showing how to use the class defined in Spectra.py.

The othor .txt files are lab data sets to be analyzed using class spectra.
